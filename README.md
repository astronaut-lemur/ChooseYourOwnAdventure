Choose your own adventure game

idk i made this for fun but it probably wouldn't be too hard to adapt it for your own cyoa game. Make sure that each scenario has three actions
to pair with it. Format like this:

scenario_name = \[\[<set the scene for the question>, <ask the question>, <action1>, <action2>, <action3>],
                [<if action1 chosen, this is the next scenario>, <if action2 chosen, this is the next scenario>, <if action3 chosen, this is the next scenario>]]
                
dictionary_of_questions = {

    'scenario name': scenario name
    
 }
