to pair with it. Format like this:

scenario_name = \[\[<set the scene for the question>, <ask the question>, <action1>, <action2>, <action3>],
                [<if action1 chosen, this is the next scenario>, <if action2 chosen, this is the next scenario>, <if action3 chosen, this is the next scenario>]]
                
dictionary_of_questions = {

    'scenario name': scenario name
